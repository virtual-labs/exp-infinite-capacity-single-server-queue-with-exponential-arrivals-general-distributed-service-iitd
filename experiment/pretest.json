      "question": "Number of customers arriving in a unit time in the system is represented by?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate",
        "b": "Mean service rate",
        "c": "Simulation speed",
        "d": "Start"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate is defined as the number of arrivals per unit time",
        "b": "Mean service rate is defined as the number of customers served per unit time",
        "c": "Simulation speed is the extent of speed with which simulation of an experiment is performed",
        "d": "Start is used to simulate the experiment for the given values of parameters"

    {
      "question": "What does the number of servers in the system represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Number of customers arriving for the service",
        "b": "Total number of service providers in the system",
        "c": "Number of service providers providing service at any instant in the system ",
        "d": "Number of service providers which are idle at any instant in the system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate is defined as the number of arrivals per unit time",
        "b": "Mean service rate is defined as the number of customers served per unit time",
        "c": "Number of service providers providing service at any instant in the system ",

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the mean arrival rate and mean service rate for the existence of a steady-state solution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate = Mean service rate",
        "b": "Mean arrival rate = Number of servers times the mean service rate",
        "c": "Mean arrival rate < Number of servers times the mean service rate",
        "d": "Mean arrival rate < Mean service rate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "For mean arrival rate equals to mean service rate, traffic intensity equals to 1, which leads an infinite number of customers in the system",
        "b": "In this case, the system will collapse due to more arrival in comparison to service in a unit time",
        "c": "This leads to steady-state solution as arrivals are less than service in a unit time",
        "d": "In this case, the system will collapse due to more arrivals in comparison to service in a unit time when the arrival rate becomes greater than the service rate"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

      "question": "Little's law defines the relationship between which of the following measures?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate and mean service rate",
        "b": "Mean arrival rate and traffic intensity",
        "c": "Mean sevice rate and traffic intensity",
        "d": "Average number of customers in the system and waiting time in the system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "According to Little's law average number of customers in the system is the mean arrival rate time waiting time of a customer in the system"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },

      "question": "In a Tea shop run by one servant, the queueing model will be best suited is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Single server model",
        "b": "Multi-server model",
        "c": "Single server with general arrival process model",
        "d": "Multi-server with Markovian arrival model"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Since the customers are served by one person and the service time follows a general distribution"
