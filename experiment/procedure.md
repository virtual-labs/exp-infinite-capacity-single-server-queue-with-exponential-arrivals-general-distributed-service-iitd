##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, set the values of parameters for the mean arrival rate, select the service time distribution, and the mean service rate for the given M/G/1 model.
###### Step 2: The mean arrival rate should always be less than the mean service rate for the existence of a steady-state solution.
###### Step 3:  Click the 'Start' button to start the experiment.
###### Step 4:  Click the 'Stop' button to stop the experiment and view the steady-state result numerically and graphically.
###### Step 5:  The theoretical and experimental results can be compared.
